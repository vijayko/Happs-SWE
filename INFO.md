# Happs-SWE

Happs is an extension to an already existing app, Happied, which offers a comprehensive catalog of bars and pubs. The Happied
app is dedicated to help users find nearby bars. With this project, we intended to create a social feed page for the page, 
where the users can post texts, images and videos related to a bar they are in. Thus, Happs is more of a feature to this 
exisiting app to manage the social feed. 

In order to develop this feature, we used Ionic Creator framework. Ionic Framework is an ideal alternative to develop apps
for cross platforms. With easy drag-and-drop features to develop the front end, one can use ionic 3 (or ionic 4) to write the 
backend of the website/app in typescript or javascript. 

Note: One can run the code in this repo using ionic commands.
